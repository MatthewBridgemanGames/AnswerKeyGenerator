# AnswerKeyGenerator
For teachers and educators who don't want to make their own answer keys.

While I'm not a teacher or educator, I can understand that it must be tiring to make multiple choice answer keys that seem random.
This program fixes that issue.

When running the program, the user is asked to input the name, number of questions and available answers to their assignment.

So for example, lets say a teacher is making an answer key for a test:
  Name: Chemistry Test 4
  Number of questions: 70
  Available answers: A, B, C, D
  
The program then goes and makes a .txt file in the same location as the program called Chemistry Test 4 Answer Key.txt with 70 questions with the answers A, B, C and D.
Since our brains literally can't do anything randomly, C is no longer the most common answer since every answer is randomized.
