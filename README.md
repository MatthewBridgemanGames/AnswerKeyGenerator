# AnswerKeyGenerator
While I'm not a teacher or educator, I can understand that it must be tiring and time consuming to make multiple choice answer keys that seem random.
This program fixes that issue in a process that takes around 20 seconds.

When running the program, the user is asked to input the name, number of questions and available answers to their assignment.

So for example, lets say a teacher is making an answer key for a test:
  Name: Chemistry Test 4
  Number of questions: 70
  Available answers: A, B, C, D
  
The teacher would run the program and tell it the previously mentioned information.  
The program then goes and makes a .txt file in the same location as the program called Chemistry Test 4 Answer Key.txt with 70 questions with the answers A, B, C and D.
Since our brains literally can't do anything randomly, C is no longer the most common answer since every answer is randomized.
